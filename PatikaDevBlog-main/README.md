d’Alembert’s principle, alternative form of Newton’s second law of motion, stated by the 18th-century French polymath Jean Le Rond d’Alembert. In effect, the principle reduces a problem in dynamics to a problem in statics. The second law states that the force F acting on a body is equal to the product of the mass m and acceleration a of the body, or F = ma; in d’Alembert’s form, the force F plus the negative of the mass m times acceleration a of the body is equal to zero: F − ma = 0. In other words, the body is in equilibrium under the action of the real force F and the fictitious force −ma. The fictitious force is also called an inertial force and a reversed effective force.

Because unknown forces are more easily determined on bodies in equilibrium than on moving bodies, the force and stress analysis of machine components can usually be simplified by using inertial forces. When developing the formulas for the stresses in a rotating disk, for example, it is convenient to assume that a representative element in the disk is in equilibrium under the action of a system of radial and tangential forces produced by the stresses and an outward-acting inertial (centrifugal) force.
